### Index.js

    starting point where following configuration has been done
    
    >>> redux 
        (for manage application state)
    >>> cookie 
        (for storing token and basic details)
    >>> Routing
    >>> history 
        (to allow user to move or jump on diff location)
    
    Router > Only take one component so we had given our app(MyApplication).
#####   ************************************************
### MyApplication
    
    > 1: componentWillMount
        checkLoginStatus method will be call, it will take cookie
        and try to check is user is exist with token specified
        based on method response it will set following three fields:
        
        1: authenticationProcess: "done"
            always when process finish it will be mark as done 
            so we can process render code otherwise we will return null.
        
        2: isAuthenticated: true/false
            based on this field it will decide which component to 
            execute from following
                1: <UnAuthenticatedUser/>
                1: <AuthenticatedUser/>
            
            if AuthenticatedUser is call we are also setting 
            some set of UI and admin role to allow/disallow 
            links
            
        3: currentLogin
            If authentication succeed backend will give
            some set of user details to identify which details
            to show based on role...

### To add/enable more apis
    
    Back-end:
    ---------
    To add/enable more api need to create endpoint as created 
    for addTask and remove task in backend using annotation
    
    Front-end:
    ---------
    Then we have to make changes inside MyApplication.constructor.state
    and need to add object like following inside adminLinks/userLinks:
    
    {
        link: "/add-task",
        displayName: "Add Task",
    }
    
    link : where it will throw user to specified link
    displayName : will display text for nav bar
    
    last we have to make changes inside <AuthenticatedUser/>
    component where based on admin/user add condition based component
    
    done
#####   ************************************************    
### Ending

    Once we have logged in component we can perform all basic flow
    and it will be handled, there will be no changes..
